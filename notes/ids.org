Disparate attributes lingering in separate sets should somehow make themselves findable once the identity of entities has been established.

But even in unification, multiple kinds of evidence has to be taken into account - one index there, and one there, with the results merged into one.

------

Given a deduplicated set of name/id/alias tuples, this should be merged in by a flow with reindexed versions of various source sets.

The overall flow has been one big speculation, and its reality must now be brought up to date.

Most simply we can project an entire new composite set here.

------

So individual bits of evidence need individual guids (or some other individualising identifier - url maybe) - this will then be carried around by all indexing stages. Each tuple therefore needs
its bag of ids.

We then do joins with potential source sets.

------

Flows can delegate to other sub-flows

Flows can include interrogation stages - where user input is required to verify choices. How these choices are actually presented is left open to whatever adaptors are available.

Such interactive steps needn't be prompt and synchronous - instead jobs can be queued up awaiting user input via some nice web UI, for instance.
